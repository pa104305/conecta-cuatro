# CONNEC 4
This program represents the game of connect 4 or 4 in line, this program is executed in a web browser
and is developed with web technologies as HTML, CSS, and JS. The files JS contain all the logic
trying to break up all the code in a smaller segments, but this code is very bad optimized.

This game is developed for practice of the logic, because this game don't have a good UI
but play this game is funny.

This program don't need dependencies, because don't use external libraries, only use a logic
based in a base function of the JS lang.
